//Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor 
//that takes an integer, Initial Age, as a parameter. The constructor must assign  
// Initial Age to age after confirming the argument passed as Initial Age
//is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as InitialAge, the 
//constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting 
//age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

//1. yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by 1.
//2.amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
//If age<13, print You are young..
//If  >= 13 and age <18, print You are a teenager..
//Otherwise, print You are old..

//import java.io.*;
