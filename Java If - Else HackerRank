//In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional statements to automate decision-making processes. An if-else statement
//Task
//Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

//If n is odd, print Weird
//If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
//If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
//If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
//Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.

//Input Format
//A single line containing a positive integer, n.
//Constrains
//1 <=n <= 100

//Output format
//Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird
